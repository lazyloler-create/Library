# Library

Library is a book and ebook discovery app. It is intended to help readers find
books, compare available formats, and choose how they want to get a book: buy a
digital copy or order a printed copy.

## What the app is for

Readers should be able to search a broad catalog, learn about books, and move
from discovery to a purchase or order. The project is a work in progress, the
features below describe the planned experience and are not all implemented yet.

## Planned features

- **Book discovery:** Search by title, author, or ISBN and explore books by
  category or editions.
- **Book details:** View available information such as the title, author,
  publication date, ISBN, page count, rating, and price.
- **Digital editions:** Find books available as ebooks and purchase a digital
  copy.
- **Printed books:** Check print availability and place an order for a physical
  copy.
- **Catalog browsing:** Browse categories and discover books related to a
  selected subject.
- **Useful search tools:** Filter or sort results by author, category, rating,
  publication date, price, and format.
- **Reader accounts and library:** Save favorites, keep a wishlist, and access
  purchased ebooks and order history.
- **Recommendations:** Get suggestions based on saved books, interests, or
  popular titles.
- **Book reviews:** Read and, eventually, submit ratings and reviews.

Digital purchases, physical ordering, user accounts, recommendations, and
reviews are ideas for the product; they are not currently implemented in this
project.

## Current implementation

This is currently a C++17 project with an early foundation for retrieving book
metadata from the Google Books API, representing book details, organizing books
by category, and caching data as JSON. The application entry point is still a
work in progress, so the complete browsing and purchasing experience is not
available yet.

## Build and run

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --target library_app --parallel
./build/library_app
```

## Google Books API setup

The project uses the Google Books API for book information. Get an API key from
the [Google Books API documentation](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started)
and add it to a `.env` file in the project root:

```dotenv
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_books_api_key
```

Do not commit your API key to version control.
